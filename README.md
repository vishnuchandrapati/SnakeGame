# SnakeGame
This is a classic Snake Game, built using Java with the javax.swing library for the graphical interface. In this game, you control a snake that grows longer every time it eats food. Your goal is to keep the snake alive by avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body.

**Key Features**

**Simple Controls:** Just use the arrow keys to guide the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).

**Start and Reset:** Press the space bar to start the game. If the snake crashes, hit the space bar again to restart.

**Track Your Best Score:** The game tracks your current score and your all-time high score for the session.

**Snake Growth:** Each time the snake eats food, it gets longer, making the game more challenging the further you go.

**How to Play**

**Start:** Press the space bar to begin.

**Move:** Use the arrow keys to move the snake in different directions.

**Goal:** Eat the food (the cyan-colored square) to make the snake grow.

**Avoid:** Don’t crash into the walls or yourself, or it’s game over!

**Reset:** After a game over, press the space bar to reset and start again.
